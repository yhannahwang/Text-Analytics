The views were amazing - quite unique. The room itself was very luxurious, we would have preferred a higher floor but was not available. The club lounge was lovely, great staff, they somehow remember your name on every visit...that was the only personal touch you feel at MBS which we liked a lot.Stayed in December 2017"

Do not expect far east hospitality and service quality. Some of the employees were lost. I have read some negative reviews about this hotel when I was  booking the rooms and unfortunately ignored them. Someone mentioned that it was like staying in a very busy terminal building. Now i see what this means. It is absolutely not value for the money.  Do not stay more than one day if you are curious about the place. By the way, there was a construction in front of the hitel and noise of the machines were terrible. Outside view better than staying there.<U+B207>Connection to metro station and shopping mallStayed in December 2017"

In addition we were not able to close the bathroom door completely and as a consequence you never had a full privacy during using the restroom. A little annoying was that you were not able to dry your hair in the bathroom because there was no single plug socket in it. How can you design such things?Besides the bathroom situation our minibar was not working properly, it had a lack and the whole water was coming out of it. In addition it buzzed the whole night which kind of distracted  us from sleeping, which is quite annoying when you pay so much money.<U+B207>The view of course is stunning, we had a room in the 27th floor and directly saw the skyline of Singapore. Also the infinity pool was a highlight although it was super crowded. There are plenty of stores ahead of the hotel, which can be reached in the basement. The MRT (Metro) directly leads into the building in the basement.Stayed in December 2017"

You can easily find another 5 star hotel in the area for half the price of this one.... but that infinity pool is unmatched!<U+B207>ahhhh the Marina Bay Sands. My wife and I will definitely remember this as one of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. It's mesmerizing from the outside as well as inside. The room itself is super clean and spacious, and if you're there on honeymoon you get a couple of extra surprising perks that make your stay even more enjoyable. Of course the best thing about this hotel is the infinity pool on the 57th floor - even if it's a bit chili to get in at first, it's all worth it as you'll have an outstanding view of the city from there. If you like (high end) shopping, there's a huge mall right outside the hotel, where you will also find some decent restaurants - we personally recommend Din Tai Fung - a Chinese restaurant that won't disappoint. The staff at the hotel are super friendly and helpful. While choosing a room to book, keep in mind that the harbor view rooms have a small balcony, while the city view rooms do not, and the premium rooms have a larger bathroom (with bathtub) than the deluxe rooms. We will definitely stay again!Stayed in December 2017"

The porter had already tagged our bags and they were sent straight to room after we checked in. As we were in tower 3 we walked the length of the hotel and it was only then we realised the size of the hotel. When we arrived at the room we put our room card into the holder to get the lights on. This after a couple of seconds prompted all the curtains to open.  Woooo ! The room was massive, bathroom massive, bed massive and the balcony massive too.As our room included free drinks and canopies at Club 55 between 5:00-7:00 it was time to chill and reflect on a fantastic room we had for the three night stay.The pool up on the 57th floor (the Worlds Largest Infinity pool) is absolutely amazing, we were pleasantly surprised that it wasn't that busy and we managed to get sun beds easy enough on our two days. There are also quite a few hot tubs at the back but still with a fab view. Drinks are served by the pool from a restaurant called Spago from the most friendly staff we have ever come across. This is also a great spot to have Breakfast in the morning, included in our club 55 package.We ate out in one of the celebrity restaurants (Bread Street Kitchen owned by Gordon Ramsay). Everything seemed perfect from the Vibe to the lovely Steak we both had. The Concierge, Nisa was really helpful recommending a cable car trip over to Santosa Island and also an open top bus trip which you can pick up just round the corner from the hotel.We would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stop here again.Stayed in December 2017"

We shared this at the front desk, they promised that they will send someone and that it will be fixed as we arrived quite late from our dinner that evening we noticed it was not solved, I went again to the reception desk to report and the wanted to send someone right away but I shared let's do it tomorrow as my son is sleeping right now as it's to late!The next day we went out the whole day and coming back late  evening and it's still not solved, everything we reported!I went down to reception desk to complain, how was it possible a company what is branding themselves to have a now worry stay.We have arranged a late check out as we went to the swimming pole on the top floor, amazing view by the way coming back to our room we discovered that we can't open the door. Making a call in hallway to the reception, they forgot to put the roomkeycard for late checkout as the receptionist is sharing with me. Standing an waiting for a 1/2 hour in our swimming suites in the hallway waiting for security, security come and ask if we can identify our self, I said I can't because we went upstairs for swimming and our paspport are in the safe of the room. He keep repeating I should identify myself otherswise he can't open the door, what an idiot is this. I need to get angry at him to open my door directly and I will open the safe and get my pasport, what a kind of friendly service is this beside of being understandable in this situation, by just annoying me.

Very equipped hi-tech rooms (like curtains open by pushing a button etc) and bathroom (amenity kit includes mostly everything you need, very high-quality cosmetics).

Just spent one night there to feel the pulse of Singapore, swim in the fantastic pool (or have a breakfast nearby) and enjoy the energy of this place and mostly 5-stars service.Stayed in October 2017"

There is an observation deck the other side so you can see over the gardens as well, 360 views of the amazing city. Best part is the pool is open til 11pm so swimming in the dark, seeing the city lit up is magical. Plenty of sunbeds and towels all included.Breakfast next day was amazing, all the food you could think of hot, fresh + so well presented. I have gorgeous waffles with syrup and fruit compote. Loads of fresh cut fruit, juices + coffees available too. Best breakfast I've honestly ever had!Throughout the staff were so welcoming, friendly and simply couldn't do enough for you.No doubt I have missed many details out of our one night stay but I won't forget it as long as I live, this place is simply perfection in one of the most amazing cities in the world.

In the lobby area, which is also a shopping centre, plenty of outside tourists promenade up and down, on the room floors there is constant coming and going (esp. on floor 34, as guests staying on floors below 34 have to change the elevator there in order to get to the pool deck) and the pool area is always crowded, especially with people (understandably) taking pictures. Even briefly after pool opening at 6 am there are already plenty of people. The pool is of course one of a kind and only hotel residents can access the pool area itself (keycard needed), however it seems most people check in only for 1 or 2 nights to have the pool experience. Temperature of the pool water matches the air temperature, hence not exactly refreshing. High prices for drinks and food (cocktail SGD 26 in the Spargo lounge on the pool deck, breakfast SGD 55) in all restaurants. The Spargo breakfast on floor 57 starts at 7 am, at 6.30 there has formed already a queue.<U+B207>Very friendly and accommodating staff at check-in and housekeeping, shower gel smells nice. Easy access to Gardens by the Bay.The room is top notch when it comes to technic features (curtains open and close automatically, automatic minibar, etc) and the bathroom offers most one might need (although a bidet or at least a hand held shower is missing). In general however it's pretty much basic, for SGD 525/night (which even appears to be the low season rate) many 5 star hotels in Singapore offer by far a higher level of pampering and detailed features. The price is solely driven by the pool. Remark: As the Spargo lounge is accessible also by non-residents and is situated on the pool deck, behind the last row with sun loungers and has open view onto the pool and the Skyline, the photo could also be taken from the bar.Stayed in October 2017"

We live London and it would hard to come back before the end of the year. I think that the hotel should not have an expiration date on its points.

There is no value for money. The hotel is a bit of a distance from other external restaurants and therefore it is difficult to get more affordable meals and alcoholic drinks. Some of the restaurants are billed as fine dining but the quality is comparatively low when considered against similar restaurants in Australia, New York, Paris, Milan and Rome. This was very disappointing and nothing drops the mood of a group of people quicker than being ripped off for terrible food. I will unlikely stay at Marina Bay Sands again because of this. Notwithstanding this, it was good to see the hotel; the accommodation is beautiful.<U+B200>The rooms were spacious and modern; the staff were very helpful and friendly.Stayed in October 2017"

The floor to ceiling windows just topped it off. Another little surprise was that the Shopping complex underneath the hotel is linked to the hotel which meant that you can get a discount in some of the shops if you show your room key.

Lots of space and an amazing sky view ! I would definitely go back again to this room. The pool is amazing, lots of people, but still it's a relaxing place. I never had a issue to find a place or a sun chair. Clearly, Marina Bay Sands Hotel is very well prepared for this amount of people ! I like the gym, restaurants, gift shop, quick access to the shopping mall. It is the best place for sightseeing in the city. Just right next to the Super Trees, downtown, Merlion, Singapore Flyer, Forest&Flower Dome, restaurants, everything is surrounding the hotel :) I'm truly happy and I will be back there one day ! :)Stayed in September 2017"

Infinite poolWater quality was very poor.3. Unfair additional chargeWe were going to check out on the desk(not choosing fast check out due to the poor quality service during our stay),and as i expected there were breakfast charge on the bill.I told the staff that I booked on the booking dot come for the breakfast included however, he said there is no breakfast in cluded package on booking.com.We show him the our reservation sheet and he discounted our added bill.In a 5 star hotel so many inconvenience experience.Never stay here again.Stayed in September 2017"

Too crowded.¡±","<U+B209>I didn't like not having access to the fridge without leaving a $200SD deposit. As I did not want to use the mini bar, this meant I could not put any of my own food or drink, such as milk or fruit, in the fridge. For some reason, milk is not supplied with the tea and coffee making facilities and I had to pay $4.00 SD every time for 100ml of milk. I thought this was outrageous! There is also no power point in the bathroom to plug in the supplied hair dryer. Had to use the power point near the wardrobe where there was no mirror and you could not see what you were doing. This is poor planning. The reception area is very busy with long queues and there is not enough seating in this vast area to accommodate those waiting to check in or for transport. There is only one sculptural type seat. Half of this is made up of some sort of green fibreglass which I sat on whilst waiting for my airport transfer. I was quickly told by security to hop off and had to stand for the next 30 minutes for my car. More poor planning.<U+B207>Good sized family room with 1 x King and 2 x Single.
