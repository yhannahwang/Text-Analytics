It's in between everything! It's near the MRT (Bugis Station) and if you opt to take a bus, its just in front of the hotel. You also have Bugis+ mall and Bugis Street Market for your shopping needs. There's even a convenience store (7-Eleven) near the place if you need anything. The staff were accomodating. They keep the place cleaned. I so love their breakfast buffet. But there are also lot of food options nearby in case you feel like trying something new. It's a great value for money!Stayed in October 2017"

The cleaning of the floor could be imrpoved. The housekeeping staff have done a great job but they were not given the right tool to do the job. From experience, I found that vacuum cleaner is not the right tool for floorboards as it doesn't completely suck out dust from floor boards. Having sensitive skin and nose, I noticed it straightaway.  Dry or wet mops with disposable microfibre cloths are more efficient. It is light and easy to work with! The furniture could be improved. One trouser hanger and a few shirt hangers in a tiny space is inadequate for 2 persons.<U+B200>The management should be proud of the staff! They all worked as a team and always wear a smile when they were approached. The housekeeping staff even helped me and my partner wheel the suitcases to the lift when they see a pair of oldies struggling with the luggage. Angie in the dining room was particularly helpful and quickly cleared a table for us when she noticed that the breakfast bar was a bit high for the oldies. She also prepared lovely noodles for me.

Of the 4 lifts, 1 lift was unavailable and the other had occasional issues by stopping a all floors on descent in the mornings.<U+B200>We stayed for 7 nights. I booked two rooms for my family. The Ibis provides a good variety breakfast including bottomless coffee etc from the auto coffee machines. The staff are very helpful. The rooms are adequate in size and have a small fridge and kettle. The beds are quite comfortable and there are also a reasonable size flat screen tv. The aircon is very good. There are laundry services available however the laundry is also accessible on the third floor. This is my third visit to Singapore in recent years and each time I have returned to stay at the Ibis. I find the cost very competitive, especially if you choose an offer that includes the breakfast option. The location in Bugis is excellent with lots going on all the time and access to the markets and the Bugis Junction shopping. There is an abundance of eating places. The opening of the Rochor MRT on the Downtown Line (400m) is a real advantage. It is only half the distance from the Ibis compared to the Bugis station.Stayed in May 2017"

The bed was extremely comfy and the service was excellent. Air conditioning was under our control, so we could turn it up, down or off depending on our required comfort level, this was huge for us as we were so glad that we weren't constantly cold. The food in the restaurant was delicious and reasonably priced in comparison to similar places, but with the most amazing food hall 2 minutes walk away we didn't eat there very much anyway. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody who wants to see the sights and sounds that make Singapore so unique.Stayed in April 2017"

I was told to wheel my own luggage on a airport trolley (don't know how the hotel has this) up to my room. I was later told by the Reception that 3 star hotels in Singapore do not have concierge services.  So for guest with more luggages it can be a challenge.The rooms are not carpeted but laid with parquet sheets. Different feel but it's a 3 star hotel.The hotel only have one cafe which doubles as a lobby bar. No variety of restaurant is available.<U+B207>This hotel has the best beds I have encountered.

After a long day at work in the hot, humid Singaporean climate it would have been nice to have a shower before I had to fly (8 hours) home.Seeing as Ibis positions itself for the business traveller, some guests may be disappointed with this facility. Offering more rooms or a paid service for more premium rooms could improve this facility.<U+B207>The range of food at the breakfast buffet was good. My room was spacious for a double room and very clean. There was a large desk but it didn't take away too much floor space. The free WiFi was great and worked throughout the hotel. The USB ports by the bed were really useful if you needed to charge multiple devices.The location was excellent - so close to public transport.
