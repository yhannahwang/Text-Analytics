This hotel is rated as a 4 Star Hotel but is definitely more like a super shabby 1,5 Star (will attach the fotos). The Staff was very unprofessional and even negatively cheeky because they seem to know how bad everything is. The Room 325 was super dirty and felt from the 80s and most parts in the whole room and in the hotel in general like shower curtains, room curtains and fridge had fungus and most parts were super rusty in general. The toilet was leaking and smelling Urin. The problem is that no one really shouldna<U+0080><U+0099>t be bothering at all about those health issuing things in a hotel no matter the category on Booking.com as we always were satisfied in the past with our bookings. We definitely would like to ask for a full refund of the 3 nights as the hotel staff was almost laughing about this request which we discussed with them as well. As it was a non refundable stay we were unfortunately tied up to this real nightmare.<U+B207>Nothing Stayed in December 2017"

There's no room for the child and they're not entitled to breakfast. It should be clear that you need to pay for an extra bed at the time of booking rather than when you arrive at the hotel so you can work out the cost and decide whether to stay there or go to another hotel. We paid for an upgraded room because it says there is a separate seating area. This turned out to be a wicker chair next to the window so we had no choice but to pay 60 dollars per night over 3 nights for an extra bed. A club room in Singapore doesn't cost this much extra.. We then discovered that the child is not entitled to proper bedding.ie a quilt. Like on the other beds but just a horrible brown blanket. As the air conditioning is on all night, my daughter was cold. We asked for a proper quilt the following morning and she was given an extra brown blanket. All in all not good enough for the price.Stayed in November 2017"

Surely, it was not approved by my bank as I didn't instruct them as such. This is illegal to do so. They could have tried to check the validity with $1 which is usually been done all over the world. Additionally, I was sent an email claiming that my card was invalid. Unacceptable and illegal claim! Later, I instructed my bank to approve this transaction and instantly they charged S $100 as deposit for the booking. Once landed at the reception, they asked for the full money to be paid and I did it. Then they informed me that the initially charged S $100 would be kept as deposit for any damage or loss, if occured during the stay, and would be reversed to my account after two weeks of our departure from the hotel. Ridiculous approach! I just intimated them that the previous night we stayed in Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard where they kept only S $ 50 cash as deposit and returned it instantly at the moment we checked-out. So, I can't accept this funny approach which seemed illegal to me. They couldn't support themselves with legality and adjusted that S $100 with the hotel bill. This time they didn't ask for any further deposit. Proactively I asked them to keep S $50 as a deposit and they did it giving me a receipt of the same.The staffs at the reception were not courteous enough to deal with the guests. The bath tub had no stopcock to hold water if you wanna have a bath inside. There was no towel hanger in the bathroom. Only two bath towels they provided keeping away any other. There was no push shower for use at the commode though there was a point in the wall for that.The restaurant at the ground floor is a complete disappointment!We asked for an iron and iron table to iron our clothes.<U+B200>The very location by the sea is excellent. Large sea facing window at the room is a bonus.Stayed in October 2017"

However this should not be the reason for cutting corners on quality in other areas (breakfast food quality and taste was a bit of a led down and the overall resort looks a bit tired and could  do with a bit of TLC . There is a great spot on the roof top , where a bar seems to have been but seems to have been stopped - shame. Insulation between the room is ok - but for rooms over looking the pool it is noisy - especially the water feature which starts fairly early for holidaymakers (7 pm). Room comfort is basic but overall good. An extra mirror in the room would be good. The aircon gets started as you leave the room to dry out the humidity in the room, I can get that in some extend  however I don't get why it is set so low. It feels like getting into the arctic especially when you com back in from the pool!...something which should really be taken care of especially...hey it might even help to be more environmentally friendly ! Last : great location in Front of Siloso beach 's attraction, that is maybe the justification for the room to be a bit costly versus what I would expect for the price.<U+B200>The right intention to be sustainable, environmentally friendly  socially engaged.Stayed in September 2017"

( but technically they should check these things function properly before receiving a guest) Service was friendly and relaxed tho not particularly knowledgable about their property, eg, where does the walking trail go and is it a loop , how long does it take to do, is there lights at night? Is there only 1 trail? What time is mosquitoes bad? Breakfast was decent basic but mainly vegetarian. Other than chicken ham sandwich. The gym they shoyld close, its a health hazard to even go in the room more than a few seconds, damp and mouldy smell really bad. Better they move its location or close it down. The tyres in the pool were fun but there were giant rusty nails sticking out is quite dangerous ( like 10cm long!) The entry from the beach tram side could use some improvement. Quite sad and run down looking. Not the best first impression tho internally it was nicer once u see the pool area. I was told by staff over the phone that as a booking.com customer ( they asked how i booked)  a taxi could not drop me into the hotel entrance, so i had to carry my bags from beach station and take a tram/ bus. Then i found out my husband who came separately got dropped off at main entrance by his cab.. so i dont know why i wasnt allowed to. Also i didnt bring my car as i was told i need to use beach carparking as there iss no hotel carpark but i saw quite alot of space when i was at hotel in their private carpark.<U+B207>Bed was comfy and i like that they have some special needs staff:) Pool is nice and nice quaint overall feel but very run down. Needs a renovation or some clean up/ repainting.Stayed in June 2017"

My first experience was lovely, no complaints so i decided to booked again the same room type. Last weekend, I stayed at room 820 for 2 days 1 night(sun/mon). I had a broken shower handle. The room has no plactic bag for the bin. When i checked in the swing at the rooftop was dirty with lizard dungs..i had to turned over the cushion. The seats at the rooftop was dusty. On top of that, there were a cigarette near the switch, the cleaner has forgotten to throughly clean the entire rooftop.Having said all of the abv, i never req. for a rm change as i do not want to trouble myself and my frens. After my 2nd visit i personally feel that he resort needs an overhaul revamp eg. 1.repaint work-There were moses growing near the walls2.need to consider a glass top shelter for rooftop room3.mgmt might want to consider revamp the rooftop jacuzzi. It cumbersome to get maintenance to come everytime. 4.the breakfast area needs to be revamp, it looks old and spread is very little. The only nice item in the breakfast is the potato dish and choco croissant.<U+B200>I like the landscape pool and the resort is overviewing the sea. choco croissant is awesome.Stayed in May 2017"

The hotel is run down & in need of lots of maintenance to return it to it's former glory.  The location is lovely & the special needs staff are all wonderful.  However, the buildings & rooms are old & in serious need of updating.  The carpets in the lifts smell from people getting into the lift whilst they are wet - the hotel should consider removing the carpets.  The whole hotel, right from reception needs an over haul.  Also, if visitors are expecting a huge buffet spread for breakfast, they should perhaps book at another hotel as breakfast is very basic & does not cater to the western diet.<U+B200>We found it admirable that hotel employs special needs staff & all the staff were absolutely lovely to deal with.Stayed in April 2017"

When I email to the hotel regards to the carpark facilities, I was only allow to park outside their hotel simply becoz I did not booked direct from them. Only guest booked direct from them will be allow to park in their hotel on a first come first serve basis.3. Their wifi is only available at common area such as level 1 n 5.

The maintenance guy came around 10pm and checked the temperature and he did not even bother to talk to us. He just kept on checking the room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes and left. He said he will be back but he never came back. We waited fo him to.come back. I called the guest services again at around 4am and they just gave us a fan! I requested for a room change but unfortunately they asked us to wait until 12pm. It was really a horrible service as they did not prioritize us the mere fact that we have a toddler with us. They did not call us to check how was everything. Until on our last day, we never received an update on the room change.  We just survived our whole 3 days on the resort with a fan on the room! Honestly, it was a bad experience and we wont be returning to the resort or recommend it to anyone we know. Nobody from the resort apologized for the inconvenience until the day we checked out. And what worse was that we paid for the whole amount while all the time we stayed on the room that is not cool and with fan!Stayed in April 2017"

Very loud music from the beach. This hotel was supposed to be the place to relax, however very loud music from the nearest beach club won't let you do it and what shocked me the most, that one day they played very loud music at night till 2a.m. Hotel stuff said they prepared for tomorrows' concert, like it's an excuse. And the concert that followed the next day was complete nightmare - windows trembling in my room the whole day from the morning till 23:30p.m. This was my last day of vacation and it completely ruined it. This hotel is not a place to relax.2. Second thing that spoiled the experience for me is a single blanket for both me and my wife - we are used to use two separate blankets. However when we asked for extra - they said the don't have extra fleece blanket and they don't have extra blanket cover! This was real disappointment.3. Wi-fi coverage is only pool and cafe areas - it doesn't work in rooms (21st century, hello!).As a summary I won't recommend anyone to stay in this hotel. For this money you could find a much better place somewhere in Singapore center.<U+B207>1. Close to the beach.2. Nice swimming pool with waterfall.3.

This got really annoying when I tried to take some rest during the day after long haul. They claim it is the insects and it will stop around 4pm. But I can bet it is artificial as its consistent and continuous. Not many options in breakfast. No bathtub. No soap near bathroom sink. You have to open the shower door, push the soap dispenser come back out if you need to wash just your hands.

I have photos of stained walls, stained lampshades, stained curtain tiebacks. Rotten Floorboards on the roof terrace. Badly maintained overall and desperately in need of a coat of paint for the room interior. The noise levels from the beach front nightclubs will ruin any ideas of a peaceful weekend laying on your terrace or snoozing the afternoon away... So bl@8dy loud !! There is obviously water ingress into the room on occasion that hasn't really been investigated or repaired properly. Roof top terrace for this room had two tired old sun loungers and a hatch with rotten boards which left a gap that could have easily caused an accident had we been up there in the evening in bad viz.<U+B200>Roof top gardens and the eco resort concept definitely a plus. View was great from the room but room was grossly overpriced for the size and cleanliness of it. Pool was very nicely laid out. We took the Aeroline Bus from KL to Sing which stops at Vivo City so its just a quick hop onto the sky train and then a short walk or trolly bus to the hotel. We liked the connectivity of the resort with the main island. Plenty to do within the resort. Clean beaches and water.

Was disheartened by earlier reviews initially but soon discovered the beauty of this place. In fact, It is exactly how a beach resort should be like and we love that it is eco-friendly and so close to nature. The deluxe room is comfortably spacious (for our family of four). Importantly, the room and toilet are very clean. Room amenities are basic but in very good condition. Other reviews described the furniture as old; we think rustic is a better description. The staff are very friendly and attentive to our needs. The lack of WIFI in the room means our family can interact better with each other instead of each being engrossed with mobile devices. Great pool - we all had loads of fun swimming in the ionised spring water and slides! Breakfast may not be international spread but it is hearty enough to start our day well! Highly recommend to those looking for a rustic and natural break from the busy city life of Singapore. And have we mentioned that the Siloso beach is just a stone's throw away? :DStayed in December 2016"

Went to reception and asked for a better room which was kindly arranged. The second room was much better. However the two neighbouring rooms were less than sociable partying all night. The night staff tried their best to sort out the two rowdy parties in the two neighbouring rooms as best as possible but to no avail. Whilst at breakfast the following morning the manager approached us and was very apologetic and moved us to the honeymoon suit. I thought his actions were very commendable. In general the hotel is located in a great area but needs a bit of investment in some of the rooms. This has the possibility of being a top rate resort.<U+B200>The hotel is in a great location for santosa island. The location is right on the beach and easy access to the mono rail which in turn allows access to all the attractions. The breakfast buffet is basic but excellent value for money. All you can eat for $20.00. Makes for a great start to every morning.Stayed in December 2016"

There was very loud banging outside our room one night until past 9pm. I had to ask for this to be stopped several times.The gym looks like something out of a 1990's horror film. This hasn't effected my review score. It is not a big deal there are plenty of walking and running paths nearby, which is more fun.<U+B200>I really enjoyed the eco aspect of this hotel.

One part of the bedroom parquet flooring creaked when we stepped on it. There were algaes on the grouts of the toilet floor tiles and at the bathtub area. WiFi is provided only up till level 5. After checking out, we asked the reception if we can keep our luggage with them while we explore Sentosa. The person whom we asked, sighed and said ok. He then told us to put our luggage by the entrance of the reception area. I thought it will be more polite if he would have offered to keep it for me instead of instructing me to do it and I didn't understand why he needed to sigh.During our stay, staff just walked past us as if we don't exist. Only one of them bothered to make conversation with us when we were in the lift together and another nodded his head at us. The price is steep, considering that certain parts of it looks like a budget hotel. E.g. the lift lobby, the breakfast area. It is really such a pity because the hotel could have been such a lovely one. 5 years ago, we have previously stayed here once, and we loved the hotel. But we no longer love it after our recent stay.<U+B200>It is around 7-10 minutes walk to Beach monorail station, that connects to the Sentosa station. If walking is not an option, we can choose to take the tram. The tram station is located right in front of the hotel.The room has a beautiful view. The slide at the swimming pool was a hit for the kids.We could see a peacock when we were having our breakfast. We also saw a squirrel near the breakfast area.Stayed in September 2016"

You can hear hammer banging noise for the room is too near the wood-working room.  The breakfast is fair, the room not clean, and most of all, after you take a shower in the bath room, the water will leak out the showering area and so the toilet floor will be wet.There is no comb in the room, and you have to ask the reception to get a comb for you.  Why? A comb is not that expensive!<U+B200>There are squirrels and a lizard walking around you when you are having the breakfast.  Most of the kids like that.The location is good.

Also if your not really into the Disney type of family holiday fun then you might be better with a city hotel. It was quite a journey every time to the city although the Singapore metro pass was great value.The hotel offers a free shuttle to the  monorail station but NOT if you have large suitcases.
