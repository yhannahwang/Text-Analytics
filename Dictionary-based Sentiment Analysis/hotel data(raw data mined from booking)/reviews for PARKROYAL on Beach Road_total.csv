Also we booked a room that you could choose as being twin or double but apparently the choice you make is of no consequence as it depends what is available at check-in. This caused a huge problem for us as we were travelling with elderly parents who required a twin room (hence selected) but were told on check-in that this wasn't possible. The staff member was not very helpful or sympathetic but finally agreed to put an extra bed in the room making it very squashed. My mother in law was not happy so made a fuss until they finally found her a twin room. Why accept a booking you can't fulfil?? Wasn't impressed how this was handled.<U+B200>The rooms were fairly spacious and the beds very comfy. Within 5 mins walk of 2 metro stations. Lovely pool and gym with steam room. Though pool very cold. Great food in the restaurant but watch out for the excluded costs and being charged 6.50 $ for tea you didn't ask for!!Stayed in January 2018"

The hotel sits right outside of the Muslim quarter with a massive Mosque theTextile Market.  The Bugis mall was about a .5mile walk to and from the hotel so it was great to save money on transportation by walking back and forth and there were lots of sales once arriving at the mall.  The pool was great, it was slightly chilly, but when the humidity and heat of the climate starts to increase it feels great.  The bar on the ground level was nice and there was a dance competition to Latin music.  I would definitely return to this property in the future as it is relatively isolated from the downtown area, which isn't hard to reach by the SMRT or a simple Uber ride.Stayed in December 2017"

I asked for a different room and had to wait until 3pm despite having arrived at the hotel around 9am - however another couple I met said they were told they could have a room at 10am.  The alternative room was much better with two good sized single beds and a view towards the Arab quarter.<U+B200>Whilst not in the hub of Singapore, location of the hotel is pretty good with an MRT station just 5 mins walk away and the Arab quarter opposite.  It's quieter than many of the hotels nearer the centre.  You can walk to many popular places such as Bugis, not too far away, and via the MRT easily get to popular tourist attractions such as Gardens by the Bay.  There are a few eating places within the hotel although I didn't use them, also a bar.  Comfort wise my room was good and clean, and the toiletries/complimentary coffee/tea were replenished daily.

There was condensation from the air conditioning on hallway ceiling of our floor and the carpet was stained, probably because of the condensation.On our 2nd day we received a note informing us that they were conducting noisy renovation work during the day - which we realized was on the floor right above us. The letter was dated Nov 3, we checked in Nov 8 and no heads up was given about this inconvenient circumstance prior or during check in. If a disclaimer was made here on booking.com about the said renovation (since I'm sure it would have been scheduled months prior) it would have at least given potential guests fair information to make an informed decision to proceed with their stay.The furniture in the room were old & dated, which is probably why they're renovating. The water in the shower became too hot one night, it was scalding even at the coldest setting, so that was a pain literally. Add that to the funky smell coming from their textile shower curtain, which I'm not sure housekeeping changes daily nor after the guest checks out.Lastly, we noticed that the chef assigned at the egg station during breakfast buffet was not courteous to guests at all. No greeting nor smile when being talked to, it seemed like he had absolutely no enthusiasm or passion about his work and was just doing the job for the sake of. What a pity.<U+B200>The lobby was ok, spacious & well lit.We dined at the Chinese restaurant of the hotel on our first night, food was good but pricey as you would expect in a hotel. Breakfast was a decent buffet spread, there were options for different tastes, preferences & cuisines.Their pool is alright, although we weren't able to use it coz of the rain, it is shared with its affiliate hotel Pan Pacific which is under the same group of companies.The bathroom amenities & fixtures in the room were good, as well.The concierge and bellhop staff were very attentive and helpful whenever we asked for assistance.Stayed in November 2017"

There was a small mix up with my accidentally being charged a mini bar bill, when I hadn't used the mini bar and they sorted it out with no problems. The pool is fantastic and a lovely spot to rest and relax in Singapore's humid climate. The hotel is situated very near Arab Street with its mix of hipstery spots for food and drink. The hotel breakfast buffet was also delicious and extensive. We particularly enjoyed the lotus pao! Rooms were clean and comfortable, and we had an excellent few night's sleep here.Stayed in August 2017"

The security deposit was $700 which, according to her, would be use to offset my room charge when I checked out. However, during check out, the other cashier told us we had to pay penalty for the previous cancel booking because it was nonrefundable, so the total price before tax was $514.8 + $756.I told her that Booking.com CSO had contacted the hotel and the hotel reservation team had agreed to change the booking for me (free of charge). She then asked me to show proof that the hotel had accepted to change my booking for free. I told her that Booking.com team had contacted the hotel directly, I only worked with Booking.com and I showed her the email from Booking.com saying that the reservation had successfully changed (luckily I got that email with me). She asked us to forward the email to hotel booking team !!! I was like: what was wrong with your internal control, how could your booking team does not communicate with front office desk???After forwarding the email and discussing with her manager, she agreed to reduce the charge but not to the price which was agreed by the check-in staff. I told her that I was more than happy to pay the actual price because it was me to change the booking date however I was unsatisfied with their internal control and communication since the check-in staff agreed to offer me the discount and now when checking out, the other staff even told me to pay the penalty.

Especially Jocelyn, She is wonderful! Even entertained my questions whenever one pops into my head. And she assured me I will be fine on actual day. She is very prompt, and timely in all her responses. Leaving nothing to imagination, she is extremely detail oriented. I love her 'can-do' attitude. Very pleased with their service.They hotel even have a spa for us to relax in after a long tiring day. The therapist in there is super experienced and awesome. I think her name is Janet/Jeanette. Sharing with me she has 40 years of experience as a masseur really did ensure me that she is doing a great job.I would like to commend them on their F&B. Very good quality food and consistent. Whether it's mass cooked from the event banquet kitchen or fresh from their cafe in the hotel to room service. The food quality is great!I enjoyed my stay and do not mind staying on level 6 again even if its for anniversary or stay-cations.Stayed in July 2017"

For example, the fruites were not 100% raped and were a bit sour, the baken was not crispy but almost fried and more stemed (was tasting strange) and so on. I'm usually not picky with food but this was 2 star hotel quality.The lady at the bar didn't care about us almost at all, she was more interested in talking with her friends ... had to wait and wait for the drinks.They give you coupons but pay attention at conditions on the back, so complicated.<U+B207>Some people working there were extremely helpful in solving some problems, unfortunately we had to ask a few times in order for them to be fixed.

Bookings.com said no deposit required.  We got given a room & when went up we discovered it was being renovated, the room was not available. The concierge sorted it out & we received a phone call from reception to ask it room was ok. Front staff reception was a downer but management was fine. They knew the wall in the room was leaking, prior to us reporting to them, housekeeping reported it 3 to 4 days earlier to maintenance, but hotel management mention nothing to us & who said unless we say something or had an issue with it, they would move us otherwise it can wait till we checked out. we opted to move when given the choice. Avoid Friday nite & weekends or Public Holidays for outings to main attractions as you will be mowed down/ squashed by the Indian locals with little or no respect. Be warned. Avoid Bugis Markets, its dirty but go to Chinatown instead its cheaper & better food. Watch out for staring glares by the locals & taxis who take the long way around. AUD was almost $ for $.<U+B200>Location was walking distance to Bugis Junction. Taxi was accessible at the hotel. Pool was wonderful. Chinatown & Bugis Markets, Marina Bay Sands are a taxi ride away & taxis are affordable even to the Singapore Zoo. MRT is close by & good way to travel to Chinese/Japanese Gardens to get away for a quiet day. Breakfast included was good & handy to have. Wifi access is great. Concierge was friendly & helpful.. (talk to Jimmy). The water corner was great to fill up a small water bottle before a days' outing & a quick drink before going back up to the room, & free in room water bottles daily are handy due to Singapores' humidity. Reported that water was leaking from the wall, I insisted it wasn't a problem as I was checking out 2 days later, I simply wanted to make them aware of it. They ended up moving us to top 7th floor for the remainder of our stay added with a surprised cake slice on my bday. 7Eleven is nearby behind the building. Smoking area out the front. Nearest Money Changer is in Bugis Junction or just use bank card for withdrawal. (Don't go to Golden Mile) Deposit was paid back in cash, a bonus, as we thought it'd be deposited back in as we paid in cash. early check in (Singapore$60 extra) & out by 12 noon.Choose the blue taxis or any taxis with flagged down rates of $3.20SKD. Great place & accessible to most popular attractions. Many Aussies stay here.Stayed in May 2017"

My initial request made along with the booking fell on dear ears and the staff had no record of it.While the hotel services are satisfactory, the hallways smell of an old building by the sea. Moreover, their housekeeping staff needs to be trained not to barge into the room after just one knock.If you're looking for a view, this hotel isn't the one for you. It's quiet and accessible. But that's all you get.The entrance has no ramps, so if you're going to need special access or have a baby with a stroller, then your best bet is the hotel staff carrying the load with you,<U+B200>Their Concierge went above and beyond. Essentially they saved the day and the duty manager offered us a complimentary ride back to the airport because of the earlier faux pas. If you're going to do the hop on, hop off bus tour, there's a stop right across the road from it.There are a laundry and convenience stores on the back of the hotel in the basement, which we didn't know about until the last night.Stayed in May 2017"

The staff were quick to react but unfortunately couldn't find the source of noise and then it went all silent. So we left it as it was.About an hour later (12.30am), the noise came back. Again the stuff were quick to action and finally found out that the noise was from the kitchen downstairs. So they relocate us to another room on level 3.I used to stayed in Park Royal on Beach Road in almost all my trips on transit in Singapore. However, the incident this time has put me back a bit. And at the the time of check in, the front desk staff told me that our room was ungraded to Premium, but I found that it was not true as I entered the room. It was rather small and simple compared to the previous Premium Room I stated before. And the window facing a wall of a building at the back.
