Rooms too small...Staff not friendly¡±","<U+B209>Was extremely disappointed with the attitude from the staff especially at reception and dining.  It seems that every guest is considered to be dishonest and a thief.  Before even providing a service its about whether or not you have paid a deposit or settled your bill.  Its all about the money.  Felt extremely uncomfortable as a guest in the hotel.  The staff need to be a little more friendly and smile.......it costs nothing....but the lasting impression may be priceless<U+B207>The location is pretty great.  The family room was a  little too small and was difficult to move around...especially if you have luggage.  The Housekeeping service was excellent.

I would like to thank Mr. Aloysius and Ms. Pei Pei at the front Desk. They were very helpful in providing tips on sight seeing locations. We were allowed to early check-in. The check in and check out process time takes less than 3 minutes. The breakfast was good and it is continental, but it was bit boring to see the same menu daily. The seating area for breakfast was very limited. There is very less option for vegetarians and no option of Indian food, however one day we were lucky to get Channa and parathas. All together the Hotel is in good location, clean but small rooms. Room Service was good. Just across the road there is Hawker food centre and there are no Indian food available. But there is an restaurant adjacent to hawker centre which serves chicken, mutton and fish Biryani and the food was good. Stayed in December 2017"

In addition, I attended the breakfast 45 minutes before the posted closing of breakfast but found that many items had run out and were not replaced--You couldn't get bananas, muffins, Jam, and other items unless you asked a staff member to go into the kitchen and replenish the buffet.

Lock of sliding wooden door of the bathroom wasn't working (either broken or deliberately kept that way) which is a privacy concern if you're staying with mixed group.

I hope it wasn't stolen, but taken with the towels by accident, but the fact is that it was never returned back. I am really disappointed with this fact as it is not accurate from personal's side. I was asked several times about it and each time I had to explain same things from the beginning - describe suite, when it disappeared etc. And this didn't had any results. I was explained that laundry service is provided by another company. But this doesn't mean anything when you loose your favourite thing. Only pictures of suite on the rooftop are left. Sad experience.<U+B200>I liked the breakfast and the service. Swimming pool on the rooftop was beautiful. Area is quite.

The pillows were flat, but I am sure the hotel would have provided more. This is a newish hotel (1.5 years) and the taxis didn't know how to find it. Show them on a map, or say next to golden tower on beach road. If you say the address itself (700 beach road), no problem, they'll get there. That's it! Honestly a great stay!<U+B207>Great hotel, with very good beds. The rooms were small (normal for singapore) but very well designed. We traveled with only carry on, big suitcases might be a problem. Air conditioner cools down the room quickly, quietly and very efficiently. The hotel is right next to little thai, and a great hawker center. There is a 7/11 kitty corner from it. Taxi are readily available day and night. The staff was super friendly, and really amicable. No problem keeping our luggage at 4 AM while we visited the city! The lavender metro is 5-10 minutes walking, or Burgis (more connections) 10-15 minutes, while walking on very cool street. You are right in the arabic part of town, with a great mosque and a palace nearby. Little india is not far either. Rooftop pool has great views, 1.5 meter deep. Lots of room for sunbathing. Lots of chairs. Always enough towels. By taxi, we were 30 minutes from the zoo, 25 minutes from sentosa, and about 20 minutes to the airport. Taxis are really great in singapore. Although breakfast was not included, it was worth it: lots of offerings, varying from continental to semi-local. Highly recommended!Stayed in October 2017"

Excellent views of city from either side of hotel to . The room was cleaned every day and fridge topped up with water too. Swimming pool area is lovely with perfect city views as well.

I had to settle this individually by contacting the property and getting decision for ""one-time exception"".<U+B200>Location: between Nicoll (yellow line) and Lavender (green line) stations means that you'll easily get here from airport via MRT and also reach main attractions.Cleanliness: rooms are modern and clean.

The first room we were given (on the recommendation of the front desk) was supposed to have a river view but instead all we could see was the very ugly high rise building immediately behind the hotel. We were very disappointed when we first saw it and felt it had been oversold! To be fair, when we asked if there was another room available (with a city view) the room was swapped and we were much happier with our new room. Had there not been another one available we would have been very unhappy as, in effect, half the hotel's room have horrible views. While there is nothing the hotel can do about that, it is pretty rich to say the rooms at the back have any kind of view and the price should reflect that.<U+B200>The outstanding feature of the hotel is its location. It is right in the heart of a vibrant part of the city, close to huge number of excellent restaurants and very handy for the MRT (Nicholl Highway stop). The rooms though are small and there was very limited space for luggage with a tiny wardrobe. We didn't eat in the hotel (the price for breakfast was OTT) and there are several very good places nearby including a 24 hour 7 / 11 for everything you might need. We felt very safe wandering around and absolutely loved Singapore.Stayed in September 2017"

From other reviews we understood that when the room was configured for 4 there would be almost no other space, the beds are more or less touching each other like one long bed and very little space for luggage etc. Knowing this in advance we were able to plan and left our main suitcases at the ""left luggage"" storage facility at the airport, as we were only there for 3 days, our hand luggage was plenty. This worked out really well, and we were very comfortable in our room. We loved the rooftop pool, this added a touch of luxury and excitement for the children, extra towels were provided at the poolside which was a great service, and the opening hours were long enough to take advantage of it after a long day of sightseeing. You can see a lot of view from the roof, including the Marina Bay Sands and the Domes. Across the road (and there is an bridge from the lobby) there is the Golden Mile Hawker centre with many food options available, as well as a mall of sorts along the road. We felt the location was great, easy to get around.Stayed in July 2017"

When we first went into our room the smell of the toilet was in a bad state. I had also dropped something on the floor and when I bent down with a torch to search under the bed was greeted with a dusty carpet and left over items from previous guests. The swimming pool at the roof is also very shallow at 1.2 meters (which may be beneficial or preferred to some people). The lifts were also extremely slow - you definitely had to wait several minutes before it arrives after pressing the button. The breakfast area is also way to small for the number of guests the hotel accommodates for. The breakfast buffet area was overly crowded and at times chaotic in the morning as several guests try to get their food in a non-orderly fashion. I also witnessed an argument from guests who had taken other guest's tables at breakfast time as sometimes tables have to be shared due to the number of people.<U+B200>The staff were helpful and friendly with all questions relating to the local area and accommodation.  The hotel is situated approximately 10-15 minutes walk from Lavender Station which I found more well connected than the closest station which was about 5 minutes walk away. There are 7/11's and other 24 hour stores a short walk away which was very convenient. The breakfast buffet is a convenient way to get breakfast without having to go out. I liked that they provided towels on the roof for the swimming pool and that the outdoor pool was very clean. The wifi is also very good and I had no broken connections throughout my entire stay.Stayed in July 2017"

The room was great for 1 or two people. The fact that we booked as a family would mean we need a bit more room. This became an issue in the bathroom. There was no space at all to put any toiletries. Some extra bench space or shelving in there would have been great.Also, the fridge never gets cold. I think our water was lucky to get to about 10 degrees. That was really annoying when you just want a nice cold drink. Also, again, space. Could only fit 4 small 600ml bottles of water in there.The pool closes at 10pm which is slightly annoying. The city doesn't stop until 10pm, so after a long day walking around taking in the city it wold have been nice to go back and chill in the pool for a little bit, but it closes at 10pm. The elevator won't let you press Rooftop after that time.The room didn't include breakfast. A friend booked a room for 6 nights including breakfast and paid less than we did for 4 nights without breakfast, so that was really disappointing.<U+B200>The rooftop pool was fantastic.One of the few places in Singapore that accommodates families and we could all get into one room. Although a little squashy, it didn't bother us too much as we only really went back there to sleep.It is reasonably close to Nicholl Hwy MRT station.12noon checkout is so good!Stayed in June 2017"

I had to pay to my credit card issuer even before I stayed in the hotel. Further, this deprived me of the option to pay the hotel bill by Forex Card to avoid the 3.5% cross currency charge of credit card issuer.<U+B200>Property location is at walking distance from Nicoll Highway MRT.

A large water bottle was under the bed, used and unused tissues, crisps and rubbish. When the foldaway bed was put away (which was touching the two beds because the room was so small) and after the cleaner had cleaned the room again, more crisps and rubbish were located on the floor. The carpets were filthy and the bathroom dirty. The toilet door could not lock as it was broken. There was two adults in our room. First day we received an adequate amount of towels and toiletries, upon cleaning they took all of the towels and replaced it with two. More of an inconvenience than anything as we arrived home around 10.30pm from the night safari. Free internet is provided at a slow speed.

The wifi was ok but cut off a few times during our stay. Of most concern during our stay was the price of the breakfasts, which came to around <U+00C2>¡ê25 each morning for two people to eat which seemed quite extortionate. However there are no utensils in the room (save for tea and coffee making facilities) meaning it's difficult to buy milk or cereal to have a much cheaper breakfast in the room. The other option is to go out for breakfast which we ended up doing eventually. Also on one morning when we did have the breakfast we were greeted and sat down and told the price would be even more expensive than the day before, which we thought was strange. We finished the meal, and instead of asking to pay with the staff member who seated us, I went to the reception desk to pay there, as I'd done the day before. Here I was charged the same price as previously. After sitting back down before leaving the hostess came over to ask if we wanted to pay and I explained we had already, she looked a bit put out and went over to the reception desk where she appeared to have strong words with the receptionist, apparently for not over-charging us. The whole situation seemed a bit off, so be careful with that if you stay here.<U+B200>I've stayed in a lot of Premier Inn's in the UK and so booked into this one based on it being one of the more affordable hotels in a quite expensive city, and with the knowledge that I knew what kind of experience I was in for. On arrival the staff allowed us to upgrade from a queen bed room to a king size room which was nice. The rooms themselves are not that large however - big enough for us but others might want a bit more space. The bed was comfortable and the pool on the roof was nice enough, although the weather was a bit hit and miss during our stay (as i got the impression it tends to be in Singapore) so came across as a little cold and windy. Location was good, we were able to walk into the main central area of the city within about 20-30 minutes, but took the nearby metro on a couple of occasions too. There are loads of nice restaurants in the area around the hotel, so plenty of choice there.Stayed in March 2017"

The hotel is new and very clean. Photos of the rooms are up-to-date.The location is not excellent, but many attractions are easily accessible. Nicoll Highway MRT station of Circle Line (yellow) is about 400m away. This line will easily take you to Marina Bay. Downtown, China Town and Little India also can be reached in a reasonable time by MRT (line change required). Lavender MRT station of East West Line (green) is about 800m away (if you make a shortcut by Pedestrian Bridge over Rochor River). This line takes you to the Changi Airport in about 50 minutes. Use bus No.100 to go to Sentosa, the stop is about 50m from the hotel. Big food center and ATMs just across the road (use bridge from the second floor). Pass the food center and you'll find a post office, post boxes and a 24/7 SAM machine (you can buy stamps here).Good soundproof of the rooms. Quiet air-conditioning which can be regulated from the room. Very comfort bed and nice linen.Swimming pool on the roof was ok.

However, this was NOT the case. Upon entering our room, we discovered that what had been sold as a FAMILY ROOM, was in fact, a standard room with 4 beds SQUEEZED into it. There was absolutely no room to move around. We had 5 suitcases, as we had just spent 4 weeks travelling around Europe, and there was barely enough space to place 2 of them on the floor. Also, the view from the windows (on both sides of the building), look out onto the neighbouring buildings. There was so little room, that the Housekeeping staff just pulled the quilts up and tucked them down between the beds. They changed the towels and this was the extent of ""cleaning"". The restaurant downstairs was located in the same area as the Reception desk. This meant that while you were eating breakfast, you were subjected to the constant (and at times LOUD), noise of large groups of people checking in and out of the hotel. You would also have to manoeuvre your way past several large stacks of luggage that people had left for the hotel staff to ""hold"". Breakfast in the hotel was also the most expensive we had encountered on our holiday. At SGD23.50 per adult (kids ate FREE), it was a very average selection of dishes to choose from. We found that if the restaurant was full, there wasn't a lot of space to move between tables, and even less when people had their prams seated by their tables. I would not recommend this facility for families (especially those with young ones).<U+B207>The staff at the Premier Inn Singapore Beach Road were very welcoming and extremely helpful. The location of the hotel is excellent, with the Nicoll Hwy MRT just around the corner (5 minute walk). It is also not far from Bugis Street markets and eateries. Great place for couples.Stayed in March 2017"

Staff always seemed distracted and when they did assist with a simple request, it seemed like such an effort, except for one lovely lady who really stood out on my last day (I wish I had remembered to take her name.) I arrived in the evening for my stay just after midnight and no one assisted me with my bags so I struggled to my room. They didn't even offer or say sorry no one is available.  On arrival they hadn't deducted my payment (as all the other booking.com hotels usually do) as they were trying to add an additional $100 SGD as a security deposit which I was told was in case I ate at the restaurant which I had no intention of doing. It wasn't an issue of me not having the money. I use a separate debit card when I travel for all my accommodation and tour costs to come off of so I transfer money to it based on the invoices costs. I had allocated for  the Singapore system of adding hotel taxes etc. I just wish they had communicated this prior to my arrival so that I could have planned accordingly or transferred money across the day before. Also no free breakfasts or any added value. Advice: Get a service offering to match your promising facility and learn to go the extra mile and communicate any possible causes for inconvenience beforehand!!!<U+B207>Given the high cost of accommodation in Singapore the Premier Inn offers a good price for a great facility. The hotel is new so everything is still in good condition. The room was great with a big comfortable bed. The bathroom could have been bigger but given that it is Singapore I guess it was OK. It is also conveniently located about 5 minutes from the subway and a short ride from the Marina Bay hotspot area.Stayed in January 2017"

The bar closed early and we couldnt get a drink in the hotel after 10.30pm. Which was surprising as It was also $55 for a glass of wine, 1 beer and a bottle of water which we needed as only tiny bottle of water in the room. This was actually more expensive than the much higher end hotels we'd also stayed in on our trip such as pan pacific and carlton city.<U+B207>Its a brand new hotel so everything is new.Stayed in January 2017"

Dont expect too much!¡±","<U+B209>Check in: We came before 13:30 and the staff immediately refuse us because the check in time is 2pm. Finally i said can we just fill all the form and later take? At the end 2pm inside lobby is like in market, because all guest would like to get the key.There is no smile, and they are all busy chit chat with each other at the back. Only 1 senior who can handle it more properly.Cleanliness: This is the worst part of this hotel.Once we go inside bathroom, we can smell 'sour smelly' from the toilet. We tried not to compalain first and write down message in piece of paper. And on the next day, its still same very stinky smell, and we just realize all the corner of the bathroom is not properly cleaned, there is a lot of deposit.Also during first night both of us feel our skin is very itchy, but no wonder because on the second day we realize that they never vacum clean the carpet, there is a lot of small particle at corner.Dust bin also not cleaned properly as we can found chocolate waste from our previous night.<U+B207>Its consider new hotel, and the price Price consider lower compare with other hotelStayed in January 2017"

Our beds were arranged as queen/portable/single sofa and this layout means that there is virtually no floor space at all, we had to have a suitcase under the desk.<U+B207>The price was right, probably because I booked before the hotel opened. Rooftop pool area was pleasant to relax in at the end of the day.The adult breakfast rates include kids for free, and the breakfasts are great to start the day with. Overall the location was fine but we did feel a bit 'off the pace'. Taxis are easy and cheap to get but we did not do much in the area around the hotel.Stayed in January 2017"
