The air-conditioning works like a charm. Lots of channels on TV. Room came with pool access and it's a really convenient way of getting to the pool.  The lounge is a really great place to chill and relax. The staff in the lounge were really attentive and replenish your drink very quickly. Very easy access to shopping at the airport.Stayed in December 2017"

Tired already and travelling with our young son I wasn't going to argue and just needed a bed. This however ruined our plans to spend the next day in Singapore. Was only the next morning after I had filled in a survey about our stay that they told us we could have our original requested checkout at 6pm... this was at 11am - as we figured we had to check out at 2pm, we would just stay in hotel til lunchtime and explore Changi airport before our next flight. Too late... still upset with lady on front desk who didn't even greet us or crack one smile (extremely poor customer service... I have worked in customer service for over 15years) we checked out at 12 (less then 12hours in hotel $530 for two rooms) hotel was fabulous just takes one staff member to ruin a guests experience and lose a customer.

We had Room 475, which you would think is on the 4th floor, which it is, except that you go to the 2nd floor, then go for a walk along winding corridors, until you come to another lift which then takes you to the floor you require. So a lot of walking was involved, which, after a day walking around Singapore, is the last thing you want. But it was not life-threatening, so not too bad.<U+B200>We initially booked this hotel for one night, as it is within the airport complex, and we were flying on to Darwin the next day. However, our travel agent made a mistake, resulting in us having to stay a second night. We also had an early check-in, at S$160, which was worth it as we could sleep in a bed immediately after getting off the plane - on which I cannot sleep. The room was large and well appointed, with a big bathroom, a desk and a king size bed. The air-conditioning worked well, as it has to, in Singapore. A 5 minute walk takes you to the MRT, which in turn takes you to the centre of Singapore via a 40-minute, $5 return train ride. A taxi is quicker but 6 times the price. And of course, we had only a short walk to check-in at the airport when we flew on to Darwin. Would seriously think about saying there again.Stayed in September 2017"

Really Really Very Rude.  We had called prior to arriving in Singapore to ask if an airport pick up was necessary as we had no idea that it was connecting with the hotel, they said it is near the airport and not connected to the airport or that we could walk through the airport to the hotel. Then they just sent a guy to pick us at the arrivals and we walked with him till the reception. firstly we were surprised and wondering why we didn't get a taxi after all the clarification over the phone...  then when we reached the venue we were even more shocked to find out that they would be charging us for an airport pick up which didn't really happen. The Receptionist at counter who received us was really rude and arguing that we have to pay even if we didn't use the service as we had booked. The Matter is  we did not ""book"" this service we only inquired over the phone and they didn't mention that  it was in the airport itself and made us confirm to pick up from airport, which to us made no sense.<U+B200>I loved the interior of this hotel and of our room.. the concept is brilliant...

Always a centrally situated hotel & welcome break after long flights¡±","<U+B209>Read above details please!<U+B207>Location at airport excellent.  However have a few seats near the Reception Desk for when there is a long line of guests waiting to book in. Although a staff member gave out a bottle of water, the wait was far too long after a long overnight flight. Why not have a ticket number for prospective guests to take and then they can sit nearby and wait. Then the reception staff calls out the number or has an electronic flashing light showing with the number. This avoids people jumping the queue which did happen and is not a good 'Singapore"" look! Porters were excellent.  Make sure all reception staff speak clearly and look at customers when speaking. Breakfast staff a bit patchy. I have often noticed when one goes off to get the next course then everything is cleared from the table, including cutlery! This has happened regularly on visits. Also staff should return to offer second cups of tea and the coffee is not up to standard so I suggest tea is preferable.Some staff are excellent, others not up to scratch. This is training or  lack of it and lack of appropriate modelling from senior staff. Is there a problem with the senior staff treating less senior ones not as well as one just did not get the best harmonious feel about the dining room with staff.This  comes from the top and one cannot blame less experienced staff; its often how they are treated and  what they see from senior staff.Stayed in July 2017"

So, we can not use the shower as we afraid that the door glass will break or fall).  Our first report was on 1st night to ""One Stop Service"" person in charge (by phone) and ask hotel to check tomorrow morning.  OUr 2nd report was on 2nd day, when we pass thru Reception, we informed receptionist about the glass door and the guy said he will ask somebody to check as we are going out and nobody in the room. But after we came back to our room at night, we found out that the door was still at the same condition as before. still making a loud sound so we dare not to open the door. No message no information whether the staff have checked and found something and sorry that they couldnt fix it nor offering changing room.

No biggie. My suggestion: take the elevator to level -2 and walk through the shops before taking another elevator up to level 2 for the hotel.If you take a taxi note that they charge +25% of regular rate starting at 6pm and +50% of regular rate after midnight... until 6am I think. And there are several airport and downtown (ERP) fees. From hotel to Raffles Hotel it was about S$30 at 7pm and back S$22 at 11pm.<U+B207>This hotel is perfect for a layover. Super easy access from Level 2 in Terminal 3. This means (a) you can take the train from Terminal 2 and the hotel entrance is just around the corner and well visible; and (b) that you can walk over from Terminal 2 (tunnel or bridge) and you end up at an elevator that you can take to level 2 dropping you off a few meters from the hotel entrance.Great breakfast buffet and very comfortable rooms with big bathtubs. You can see the TV from the tub... just in case you need another reason to soak longer.Stayed in May 2017"

I messaged the hotel through booking.com when I made and paid for the reservation. Unfortunately, when I arrived the hotel told me there were no rooms available until 10am and I had a meeting at 10am. They did offer me a poolside berth with access to the showers and facilities, but this was not ideal as I needed to get a quick nap having not slept for over 24hours travelling from China. I ended up paying an extra SGD$170 to get a suite.They could have informed me prior to my arrival about this eventuality, I would at least have been better informed upon arrival.<U+B207>If you need to be near Changi Airport then this is a great hotel. If you are on business and need to get a hotel near the airport to have meetings and networking sessions etc, this is your hotel. The location enables you to easily walk from the hotel lobby to any of the main departure terminals in around 5-15 minutes. For muslim travellers, the hotel's Azure restaurant serves Halal food.To get to the usual Orchard Road haunts for tourists and visitors, you can either use a taxi which takes 15-20 mins or go downstairs through Terminal 3 (where the hotel is located) to use the MRT train service which should get you to Orchard Road in about 30-40mins depending on the train changeovers. Taxis (avg SGD$15-20) will cost the single traveller about 4-6 times as much as the MRT (SGD$2.50) per single journey.Finally, because the hotel is basically part of Terminal 3 and within easy foot traffic reach of Terminal 2, you have a variety of local and international restaurants and retail outlets at your doorstep, including a good variety of 24 hour F&B options so you don't have to rely on the hotel for eating out no matter what the hour.Stayed in May 2017"

Mayonaise not listed in club sandwich ingredients in room service menu, mayo is an allergen and should always be listed!

That however got dealt with by the Duty Manager (Bonny?) who worked out that the Concierge was being a bit silly. After all, I had made mention a few times that I was travelling with three kids one of which suffers with a medical health condition.  Nevertheless, by the instruction of the Duty Manager, a Porter was sent to walk us through to the other side of the hotel from the airport. One would think that the Guest Relations Manager would play small part in this as I'm certain that the Duty Manager would have to play a much 'bigger' part to play in welcoming other important guests. There was no effort put in whatsoever, on whether my sick daughter needed assistance any more help  once we got into the room. I too, didn't bother asking anyone for assistance for my daughter who not that it mattered much but my sick daughter  had a seizure once we got into the room. I felt that I am bothering the staff, as I recall, I had to  call a few times until somebody in Room Service answered the phone. Reason for call, order food and second time round, I needed warm milk for my one year old as there weren't any microwaves in some rooms. That too felt like a far stretch. I guess that I shouldn't complain too much as the Receptionist was very prompt in giving us a wake-up call at 09:00am the next morning. On your bicycles now guests, we need you out  for the next lot of guests to occupy the room you in, hahahhhahahhahahhahaahahha!<U+B200>The fact that the airport terminal 3 was situated within walking distance to the hotel.

They greet you, they are very friendly and helpful. But what I encounter is when I wanted to do a check in at the counter. The staff greeted me and is very polite however he speak too fast, I think he get very use to the lines that he often speak to the customer. Especially when he was trying to give me the direction to my room. Well, speak lively and clearing will give your customer a better understanding.2) I understand that The Carpark does not belong to the hotel but I'm sure that, there will be some way the hotel can provide complementary Carpark tickets for the customer who are staying at the hotel. Because during my first stay I am provided but not this time :(   (Upon request for the complementary Carpark ticket, I was told that the Carpark does not belong to the hotel) The Carpark chargers at the airport is expensive. I hope the next time I stay in the hotel I won't be paying the Carpark chargers. Thank you.<U+B200>I spent 1 night in the hotel together with my wife and daughter. This is the second time we stay there. We have a wonderful time. For me, location of the hotel is very good. Right at the airport Terminal 3 with many shop and  restaurants. You can travel to Terminal 1 or 2 easily via sky train (FOC) My room is clean and spacious with a king size bed. Just nice for 2 adults and 1 child. The bed is very comfortable. Overall design of the room is nice and modern. You don't have to worry about the plane sound and is very quiet in the room.Our toilet is clean and big with a bathtub. There is a very big window just beside the bathtub and you can enjoy the view while soaking in. (Windows can be shut for privacy purpose)We have a great time in the swimming pool (Outdoor). In the morning, I went to the gym and run on the track mill. You want to consider to come in early, because there is only 3 track mill and you might ended up waiting for your turn. The Gym is clean but size is not big, Basic equipment is provided. I enjoy my gym session anyway.Our stay included breakfast. I travel to a few countries before and I will recommend the breakfast this hotel offered. Varieties of food and Restaurant is clean. Breakfast is very nice too.Thank you.Stayed in April 2017"

The room was very comfortable with an excellent bathroom.  The hotel pool was lovely and the breakfast buffet was very good, in fact better than a recent cruise ships offering!  Towels were supplied at the pool and there is also a small gym although no bikes (cross trainers and treadmills).  Please bear in mind that this is a hotel next door to a busy airport so there was some noise when sitting by the pool and despite the rooms having very good soundproofing, you could hear the occasional take off.Nearby there are a huge number of food outlets at the B2 level and also in the upper levels of the Terminal 3.  There is a small supermarket, chemist and a number of other outlets as well.  We stayed for four nights and access into the city with the SMRT train or the 36 bus was easy especially with the 3 day tourist pass which can be purchased at the airport MRT station via Terminal 2 and gives unlimited travel on the SMRT services.One surprisingly useful feature provided by the hotel in the room was a mobile smart phone which can be used to access the internet while travelling around Singapore.  It also give you free international calls to certain countries including the UK.Stayed in April 2017"
