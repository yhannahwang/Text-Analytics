Later, I instructed my bank to approve this transaction and instantly they charged S $ as deposit for the booking Once landed at the reception, they asked for the full money to be paid and I did it Then they informed me that the initially charged S $ would be kept as deposit for any damage or loss, if occured during the stay, and would be reversed to my account after two weeks of our departure from the hotel Ridiculous approach! I just intimated them that the previous night we stayed in Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard where they kept only S $  cash as deposit and returned it instantly at the moment we checked-out So, I can't accept this funny approach which seemed illegal to me They couldn't support themselves with legality and adjusted that S $ with the hotel bill This time they didn't ask for any further deposit Proactively I asked them to keep S $ as a deposit and they did it giving me a receipt of the sameThe staffs at the reception were not courteous enough to deal with the guests The bath tub had no stopcock to hold water if you wanna have a bath inside There was no towel hanger in the bathroom Only two bath towels they provided keeping away any other There was no push shower for use at the commode though there was a point in the wall for thatThe restaurant at the ground floor is a complete disappointment!We asked for an iron and iron table to iron our clothes The very location by the sea is excellent Large sea facing window at the room is a bonusStayed in October "

Is there only  trail? What time is mosquitoes bad?
