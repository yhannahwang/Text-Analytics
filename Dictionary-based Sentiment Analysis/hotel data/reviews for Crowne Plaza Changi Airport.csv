The reception staff were excellent and very helpful - with an IHG membership card we were able to hold one of the  rooms until pm the next day at no extra costThe room was fabulous and very well equippedWe had landed from Bali at Terminal  late into the evening - the Crowne Plaza is adjoining Terminal It is very well signposted in the Terminals and as long as you follow the signs and use travelators etc then it is easy to reachEnjoy that fabulous room then have an excellent breakfast next dayThere are  types of rooms  - one is a set of rooms that is very close to the taxiing aircraft  - the others are on the opposite side and are quiter - neither are that noisy as the sound insulation is excellent! Make time to enjoy the design award outside swimming pool at the hotel set out in a tropical garden theme - just be very careful with sunburn as even with an overcast day the UV is still very strong as you are near the equatorNext day we were travelling from Terminal  - use the rapid transit railway - its free!Really could not fault the hotel and its amenities - thank you Crowne Plaza!If this is your first time at Singapore Shangi be aware that in Terminal  the security detailed check takes place in the actual room of the departure gate so be prepared for additional time at this last stage before boarding - with A Airbus carrying + passengers you need to get to the gate as soon as the board confirms that the gate is classed as ""open"" - hope this helpsStayed in January "

Always a centrally situated hotel & welcome break after long flights¡±","Read above details please! Location at airport excellent  However have a few seats near the Reception Desk for when there is a long line of guests waiting to book in Although a staff member gave out a bottle of water, the wait was far too long after a long overnight flight Why not have a ticket number for prospective guests to take and then they can sit nearby and wait Then the reception staff calls out the number or has an electronic flashing light showing with the number This avoids people jumping the queue which did happen and is not a good 'Singapore"" look! Porters were excellent  Make sure all reception staff speak clearly and look at customers when speaking Breakfast staff a bit patchy I have often noticed when one goes off to get the next course then everything is cleared from the table, including cutlery! This has happened regularly on visits Also staff should return to offer second cups of tea and the coffee is not up to standard so I suggest tea is preferableSome staff are excellent, others not up to scratch This is training or  lack of it and lack of appropriate modelling from senior staff Is there a problem with the senior staff treating less senior ones not as well as one just did not get the best harmonious feel about the dining room with staffThis  comes from the top and one cannot blame less experienced staff; its often how they are treated and  what they see from senior staffStayed in July "
