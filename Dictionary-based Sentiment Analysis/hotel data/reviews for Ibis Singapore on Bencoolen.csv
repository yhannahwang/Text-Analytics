The furniture could be improved One trouser hanger and a few shirt hangers in a tiny space is inadequate for  persons The management should be proud of the staff! They all worked as a team and always wear a smile when they were approached The housekeeping staff even helped me and my partner wheel the suitcases to the lift when they see a pair of oldies struggling with the luggage Angie in the dining room was particularly helpful and quickly cleared a table for us when she noticed that the breakfast bar was a bit high for the oldies She also prepared lovely noodles for me She made sure that we were looked after in the dining room Many thanks, Angie!Stayed in October "
